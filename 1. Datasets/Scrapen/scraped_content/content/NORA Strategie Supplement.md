Ten basic principles
NORA contains of ten basic principles which relate to the provi-
sion of services. ‘Service’ in this context includes all activities by
or through which service providers carry out public tasks. The
underlying principle is that clients (citizens, businesses and other
public sector bodies) take centre stage in the service relationship.
Citizens, businesses and public sector bodies (the clients)
...are provided with the service they need.
...can find that service easily.
...have easy access to the service.
...experience uniformity in service provision and in the use of
standard solutions.
...are offered related services as a package.
...have access to information relevant to them.
...are not confronted with unnecessary questions.
...can rely on information not to be misused.
...can rely on service providers adhering to arrangements.
...can provide input about the service provisioning.

Introduction
NORA (which is the acronym used for the Dutch
Government Reference Architecture, Nederlandse Overheid
Referentie Architectuur) is a description of the principles
underlying the design and linkage of the information
systems used by the Dutch government. NORA’s Strategy
Supplement lays the basis for this.
Target group and objective
NORA’s Strategy Supplement was written primarily for
executives of organisations that carry out public tasks and
services, in particular for the owners of IT policy portfolios.
The Supplement is also of importance for anyone who is
involved in the government’s information policies, including
information managers, members of steering groups,
programme managers, project managers, architects, auditors,
policy officials and advisors.
The Strategy Supplement aims to explain what NORA is,
why NORA is important, how NORA should be used and also
4
NORA’s definition
The Dutch Cabinet has endorsed NORA as the standard to be used throughout the
public sector. NORA contains common basic principles that relate to the provision of
all public services.
‘Service’ in this context includes all activities by or through which service providers
carry out public tasks.
The term Architecture as used in NORA refers to common basic principles that
will be used in designing systems (conceptual, logical or technical). The design of
systems is included in the NORA concept only in as far as it is relevant from an
interoperability point of view. All possible interpretations of the word Architecture
(e.g. involving organisation, information-design, system-design, network-design, etc.)
are therefore included in this document from that single point of view.
All other points of view leading to Architecture artefacts are subject of study and
definition in other relevant documents of the public sector.

what, in general terms, the broad outline of NORA’s principles
implicates. On the basis of this information, the reader can
determine how NORA should be used within his or her  own
organisation.
The Strategy Supplement lays the foundation for the practical
application of NORA. Details will be elaborated in separate
documents for the use of the relevant specialists.
Contents
The Strategy Supplement includes the following chapters:
1.
NORA - in brief: the whys and for-whats  of NORA.


This section can be read as a separate entity if you


only wish to become acquainted with its main points.
2.
Using architecture as a governance tool: how NORA


can be used as a management tool.
3.
Definition of concepts: a description of the main


concepts used in NORA; the concept of



‘interoperability’ is explained here in more detail.
4.
Basic principles: the ten basic principles used in and


by NORA to achieve interoperability. These principles


can be used as the basis of an assessment framework


within your own organisation.
5.
Building blocks: a description of the principle


standard building blocks that are available for

implementing interoperability.
The development of NORA
The Strategy Supplement was developed by the
ICTU programme RENOIR 1in collaboration with the
Standardization Forum Bureau Forum Standaardisatieunder the overall supervision of a group of experts in the
field. Following public consultations, the Supplement was
endorsed by the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom
Relations Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelatiesat the
recommendation of the Standardization Council College
Standaardisatie.

NORA 1.0 (2006) and NORA 2.0 (2007) were published as
stand-alone documents. From NORA 3.0, however, NORA
comprises a number of separate but linked documents. The
Strategy Supplement is one such document. It replaces
chapters 1 through 3 of NORA 2.0. In terms of content, the
Supplement ties in with NORA 2.0 although the text has been
rewritten in response to a call for a more compact NORA
aimed at management executives rather than architects. The
choices made in this Supplement, the way of working and the
changes in comparison to NORA 2.0 are explained in detail
in a separate section. The basic principles of the Strategy
Supplement will be elaborated later in a number of other
Supplements.
Until that time, the principles derived from NORA 2.0 will be
used to complement the basic principles underlying NORA 3.0.
The insights on which NORA is based are subject to constant
change and adaptation. The same applies to the ever-
changing demands made on the government by citizens
and businesses, in the light of new social and technological
developments. Within government itself there are also many
issues that are still being investigated, debated and decided.
NORA is a catalyst in this process, and findings and outcomes
will be presented in specialist NORA documents as they arise.
In short: NORA is a dynamic product that is unlikely ever to be
finalised.
The process for the development of NORA has been described
in the NORA Charter. Anyone who wishes to keep abreast of
NORA developments, or would like to contribute to the project,
is encouraged to contact us. This Strategy Supplement
provides the developers of the specialist NORA documents
with the framework within which they operate.

1.	NORA - in brief
Dutch citizens and businesses alike expect the public sector to
function properly and provide adequate service. To achieve this,
cooperation between the various government organisations and
agencies is absolutely essential as it allows them to harmonise
their processes and make use of each other’s data. The
‘Nederlandse Overheid Referentie Architectuur’ - referred to by
the acronym NORA and set up to support this cooperation - is
the Dutch Government’s reference architecture.
A properly functioning public sector
Dutch citizens and businesses alike expect the public sector to
function properly and provide service. They want a public sector 5:
• that provides answers to questions of the public; that offers

state-of-the-art service to citizens and to the business sector,

and that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week;
• that does not require information that is already available and

reduces the administrative burden it must necessarily impose

upon its citizens and businesses to the lowest possible level;
• that cannot be fooled: that is known to act decisively against |

fraud and that enforces legislation, regulations, licences and

suchlike;
• that knows what it is talking about: that obviously builds and

implements its policies on a sound basis of knowledge and

access to information;
• that can be relied on: that stands for legal certainty and legal

equality;
7
NORA’s status
The Cabinet has endorsed NORA as the standard to be used throughout the pu-
blic sector 23. Documents in which this status is reflected, include the agreement
concerning the National Services Implementation Programme and e-government
(NUP), already approved at various executive levels 4, and the model architecture for
government services known as MARIJ (taken as an acronym from Model Architectuur
RIJksdienst) which is intended to serve as reference architecture for ICT projects in the
governmental domain 3.

• that costs no more than necessary: that demonstrates

that it can carry out its tasks efficiently due to a sound

organisation and modern resources.
Managerial challenges
Many societal issues demand intensive cooperation between
government agencies. Take, for example, the different
departments involved in the processing of licences and
permits, or the coordinated approach of schools, welfare
services and police in the case of delinquent teenagers.
Intensive cooperation of this kind is only really possible when
there is interoperability between government agencies, that is
to say that they should be capable of sharing and exchanging
information with each other, with citizens and with businesses
in an effective and efficient manner.
The Cabinet states that interoperability increases the
effectiveness and flexibility of public administration. It sees
the concept as an “essential precondition for the future-proof
development of services and applications that are possible
with, or made possible by, IT in the broadest possible sense”
6.
When individual organisations start working together, they
will encounter each other’s systems and processes but also
possible confusion of ideas, cultural differences, and conflicts
of interest. Such issues can only be resolved by making
arrangements about the definition of concepts, the way in
which data will be processed, the infrastructure to be used,
etc. As the number of parties involved increases, bilateral
arrangements soon become practically impossible.

Working with NORA
NORA provides a framework that simplifies the process of
making inter-organisation agreements and, in some cases,
it will render such arrangements unnecessary. NORA is
a checklist of generally accepted basic principles for the
design of processes and systems with interoperability in
mind. Organisations and bodies that work with NORA
choose to align themselves to a number of widely shared
principles and the accompanying conceptual framework.
This makes it easier for them to make arrangements with
other organisations and bodies that operate according to
the same principles.
In practice it will be difficult to conform to all these principles
at the maximum level. What matters most is that public
sector organisations support and commit to the principle of
cooperation, and fulfil the principles wherever possible. In
doing so, these organisations will be embarking on a growth
curve in maturity, one in which NORA provides the signposting.
9
Definition of interoperability
Interoperability is the ability of organisations (and their underlying processes and
systems) to share information with their environment in an effective and efficient
manner. In the context of NORA, interoperability concerns the sharing of information
between a public sector organisation on the one hand and citizens, businesses
and other public sector organisations on the other hand, irrespective of the type of
information and the way in which it is shared. Interoperability concerns information
processing, but also touches on operational management and the technical facilities
required.

Costs and benefits
Cooperation demands an investment in terms of time and
money. Quite often, the costs initially outstrip the benefits.
Moreover, the costs are not always shared equally among the
departments concerned, and the benefits can not always be
expressed in monetary terms. Nonetheless, the benefits can
be substantial (for both individual departments and the public
sector as a whole):
• savings by making use of generic solutions and avoiding

double work;
• improved quality, for instance by making use of


unambiguous, reliable information;
• ensuring the cohesion between developments within and

outside the own organisation;
• standardization. This improves flexibility, as the


organisation is better able to cooperate with other bodies,

citizens and businesses.
The use of NORA will increase the effectiveness of
investments by coordinating and harmonising the efforts of
the various departments and bodies. Although working with
NORA will call for an initial investment (in the acquisition
of know-how and the appraisal of plans), the costs will be
modest in comparison to the costs of implementing the
10
In practice: environmental permits
Anyone who wants to build a house is confronted with various permits and
regulations. There are regulations related to living, to space and to the environment,
and each set has its own criteria and procedures. These permits are then granted by
different public sector bodies. This is a confusing, time-consuming and expensive
situation for citizens, businesses and for the government itself. Moreover, it can lead
to contradictory decisions.
The Environmental Permits (General Provisions) Act brings an improvement to this
situation by clustering all the various components into a single environmental permit.
Applications are dealt with by a dedicated department of the local municipal council.
The separate aspects of the permit are still appraised by different public sector
bodies, but their activities are coordinated so as to produce a single decision.

actual plans. The insights that are acquired from the appraisal
of plans will lead to substantial savings. Adjustments in early
stages will prevent costly rectification at later stage and will
help manage and contain the risks involved.
What is NORA based on?
NORA is based on existing government policies (both
national and European) and on the instruments that have
been developed in the context of those policies, such as
laws, regulations, parliamentary documents, administrative
agreements and the results of previous government
programmes. NORA accesses these resources with due
regard for mutual relationships and places them in the context
of interoperability. The underlying policy principles may not
always be directly applicable and, in such cases, NORA will
effect a transformation. In doing this, NORA’s actions will
be based on insights shared by the professionals who are
responsible for implementing the policies.
Ten basic principles
NORA contains ten basic principles that relate to the provision of services. ‘Service’
in this context includes all activities by or through which service providers carry out
public tasks. The underlying principle is that the clients (citizens, businesses and
other public sector bodies) take centre stage in the service relationship.
Citizens, businesses and public sector bodies (the clients)
...are provided with the service they need.
...can find that service easily.
...have easy access to the service.
...experience uniformity in service provision and in the use of standard solutions.
...are offered related services as a package.
...have access to information relevant to them.
...are not confronted with unnecessary questions.
...can rely on information not to be misused.
...can rely on service providers adhering to arrangements.
...can provide input about the service provisioning.

2.	Using architecture as a management
instrument
NORA is a management tool. It is the responsibility of
policy makers to formulate a policy concerning how the
instrument should be used. This chapter addresses the use
and application of NORA.
Management tool
Executives and senior managers can use NORA as a
checklist of principles through which to assess planned
changes. The sharing of information with citizens, businesses
and/or public sector organisations is an important aspect of
such plans. The changes might concern the development
or modification of processes and systems, formulating
legislation and regulations, the recalibration of a set of
tasks, a merger of departments or agencies, etc. NORA
can be consulted in all such circumstances, from the first
moment a change is considered, through the formulation of
the assignment and the concrete requirements which the
proposal must fulfil, to the tendering, the development, the
implementation and the maintenance of the result.
NORA does not include the mechanics of the steering
process as such. This makes it possible to use NORA
in combination with various governance models and
management methods. The only assumption made is that
the process will follow the familiar ‘plan-do-check-act’ cycle
7. Within this cycle, NORA is relevant at the ‘plan’ stage,
where the planned results are validated and appraised.
Subsequently, the governance process ensures that the
approved plans are actually implemented.

17-05-2010   16:26:09

## Page 13

Guidance
NORA is not a blueprint that can be used out of the box in
a rigid way. Rather it is a checklist of quality characteristic.
These quality characteristics - in the form of design principles
- are translated into quality standards - in the form of
appropriate and relevant design decisions.
Using the checklist helps ensure that the most important
choices are considered at the right time and at the right
place. NORA also includes best practices to assist the
decision-making process. These will be continuously
supplemented on the basis of new experiences.
Scope
NORA is relevant to the performance of any public task by
an organisation from either the public or the private sector. In
this context, NORA is only concerned with the ‘information’
aspect, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity. In
other words, it is concerned only with those issues that
necessitate government-wide agreements so as to ensure
efficient and effective information sharing. Within NORA, this
is covered by the concept of ‘interoperability’ (see page 7
for a definition of this term). For that reason, NORA is also
referred to as the Dutch Interoperability Framework.
Status
Some of the principles of NORA are based on existing
legislation and judicial rulings. In all other cases, there is no
jurisprudence relating to compliance or non-compliance with
the principles.
It is not deemed fitting to enact legislation for all principles,
as this would disrupt the administrative relationships and
impinge on the autonomy of the organisations in question.
13

17-05-2010   16:26:09

## Page 14

NORA is intended as a tool to improve the cooperation
between organisations; cooperation presupposes that the
participants themselves bear the responsibility for making the
necessary arrangements.
The management of each individual organisation will
determine how NORA is to be used, will make resources
available and will monitor implementation. Opting for NORA
signifies that an organisation agrees with the principles and
is committed to working actively towards implementing those
principles in practice.
Roles
A number of separate roles can be distinguished in the use
and further development of NORA.
Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations
The Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations Ministerie
van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties, BZKis
NORA’s owner/principal. In that capacity, the Ministry uses
NORA as the compass by which it can ensure a properly
functioning public administration. As time goes on, other
organisations in the public sector that implement BZK
policies will find themselves confronted with NORA more and
more explicitly.
14
Cabinet policy
The Cabinet endorsed NORA, and the architecture for government services -
known by the acronym MARIJ - which is derived from NORA, to be  the reference
architecture for ICT projects in the government domain 3. In context of the National
Services and e-Government Implementation Programme (NUP), the government,
municipalities, provincial authorities and water boards have agreed that all projects
must be aligned with NORA 4.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   14
17-05-2010   16:26:09

## Page 15

Representative executive
The representative executive is the builder of bridges
between organisations. This person (the male pronoun will be
used for convenience, without intending any discrimination)
is active within various cooperative alliances for advice,
consultation, coordination or management. He makes
reciprocal agreements to use NORA as a guiding principle
and advises others to do so as well. Where necessary, the
representative executive will take the initiative to develop
a domain architecture (which describes the information
management system in use for a specific part of the
government) and ensures that a control structure is put in
place with a broad enough mandate to administer supra-
organisational projects.
Chief executive
The chief executive of any individual organisation takes on the
role of sponsor, commits to abiding by NORA principles and
uses them as the point of departure for his own organisation.
The chief executive endorses the general directives and
ensures that these are followed consistently. He supports
the application of NORA’s way of thinking and makes the
necessary resources available to this end. If necessary,
he takes the decision to develop an organisation-specific
architecture. Finally, he makes choices and decisions
involving any issues that arise as a result of using NORA.
15
Standardization Council
One important source of advice for the government is the Standardization Council (co-
developer of this NORA Strategy Supplement). This Council consists of top-ranking civil
servants from various public sector organisations who are involved in the development and
implementation of policies. The Council is assisted by the Standardization Forum, which
includes representatives of the government, the business community and academia. The
Standardization Council is using NORA as the interoperability framework for the Dutch
government and recommends its use as a standard throughout the public sector.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   15
17-05-2010   16:26:09

## Page 16

Manager
He ensures that sufficient know-how and skills are in place
for the implementation of NORA. This primarily concerns
the system architects, but will also concern other staff who
are incidentally involved with NORA, such as managers,
project managers and auditors. The manager updates the
methodology and the processes, so that all concerned
are aware of who takes the decisions and in what way
cooperation with other organisations is put into effect. He
oversees the testing of plans in view of NORA’s principles and
ensures that changes actually take place in accordance with
the plans. Where necessary, the manager will put possible
choices before the relevant responsible executives.
Architect
The architect is both advisor and designer. He is fully
familiar with NORA in all respects. He implements NORA’s
principles and translates them to suit specific situations. He is
responsible for updating the architectures (i.e. principles and
design) of the organisation on the basis of relevant elements
from NORA. He assesses plans on the basis of the NORA’s
principles. Where necessary, he will put possible choices
before the relevant responsible management. He makes a
contribution to the development of NORA and to the various
domain architectures.

3. Conceptual framework
One of NORA’s functions is to develop a common
conceptual framework. This chapter addresses a number
of the basic concepts. Consensus concerning the meaning
of these concepts is crucial, as they determine the meaning
and scope of NORA itself.
NORA uses broad definitions for key concepts such as
‘interoperability’, ‘information’ and ‘service’. As a result, the
implications of the basic principles are far-reaching. The
broad definitions allow ample scope for interpretation and
this scope underlines the guiding character of the basic
principles.
INTEROPERABILITY
Interoperability is the ability of organisations (and their
underlying processes and systems) to share information
with their environment in an effective and efficient manner.
In the context of NORA, interoperability concerns the sharing
of information between a public sector organisation on the
one hand and citizens, businesses and other public sector
organisations on the other hand, irrespective of the type of
information and the way in which it is shared.
17
Types of information
There are many types of information that can be shared within the public sector. A
number of examples (not restrictive):

• information about persons, organisations and objects (buildings, vehicles, etc.);

• information as part of any stage of any process, such as a completed request


for a permit, an order or a complaint;

• information that the government produces as a consequence of processes,


such as policy documents, legislation, investigations, licences and permits;

• information about how the public sector operates, such as service descriptions,


conditions for supply or provision, and reports.

17-05-2010   16:26:09

## Page 18

Aspects of interoperability
Interoperability primarily concerns information processing,
but also has impact on operational management and the
technical facilities required.
• Business processes: the production and use of


information. What information is available? How is it

used? What services does it facilitate? Which

organisational components are involved? Who is

responsible for it? How are arrangements made? How

quickly are replies received? Which work processes are

involved? Etc.
• Information processing: the information itself. This

concerns the meaning (semantics), quality, form (on paper,
 	 electronic, etc.), availability, manageability and

sustainability, message traffic, choice of channel,

administration, sources, flows, etc.
• Technical facilities: resources and equipment. Which

systems are in use? How is information stored? What

network facilities are needed? How has technical operation

and maintenance been arranged? Etc.
A more detailed analysis of the concept ‘interoperability’
and its role within the Dutch public sector can be
found in ‘Towards a Dutch Interoperability Framework.
Recommendations to the Standardization Forum’ 5.
18
Communication channels and forms
There are many different channels through which information can be shared. These
include internet, post, telephone, personal contact and  television. Within each
channel, information can also be shared in different forms. A number of examples
(not restrictive): websites, e-mail, electronic messages, letters, forms, direct mailing,
by telephone via a call centre, personal visits to an information desk, home visits, or
educational films.

In practice: Benefits Intelligence Agency - a spider in its web
Only those citizens who truly have no income of their own can claim state welfare
benefits. The local social services departments therefore need to check the
legitimacy of any claim. The Dutch Benefits Intelligence Agency Inlichtingenbureausupports them by comparing the information provided by claimants against data
held in other public sector registers. Details of a claimant’s income and work
status can be obtained via the Employee Insurance Agency Uitvoeringsinstituut
Werknemersverzekeringen, UWV, the Tax Office and the Information Management
Group Informatie Beheer Groep, IBG, which deals with students. A check can
be made via the Custodial Institutions Service Dienst Justitiële Inrichtingen, DJIwhether the claimant has ever been imprisoned. The Benefits Intelligence Agency
therefore shares information with other government agencies and departments.
This means that the claimant no longer needs to provide all this information himself
and social services staff do not need to send individual enquiries to each of these
government organisations.
SERVICE
A service is a specific contribution provided by a person or
organisation (the service provider) in response to a need in
its user environment (as expressed by the consumer).
Within the public sector domain, the term ‘service’ is often
used to describe a particular type of contribution, such as
issuing a passport. In the context of NORA, however, the term
has a wider meaning: a service includes everything a public
sector organisation can deliver for a user. A user can be a
citizen, a business or another public sector organisation.

The term ‘service’ is pivotal in the context of NORA,
because information sharing characteristically ensues from
a request for or the provision of a service. For the outside
world, services represent the ‘conspicuous’ public sector
(as opposed to the internal organisation, its processes and
systems). But even from the inside, services are often central
to the public tasks carried out by and within the public sector.
This makes the term ‘service’ an ideal starting point when
formulating the preconditions that interoperability imposes on
public sector organisations. These preconditions have been
translated into NORA principles.
NORA PRINCIPLE
A NORA principle is a criterion that a service (as provided
by a public sector organisation) is expected to fulfil in order
to improve the interoperability of that service.
Principles impose constraints when designing services (and
their underlying processes and systems). In so doing, they
also set guidelines or standards  for the development of
services. With a few exceptions, a principle is applicable -
irrespective of the nature of the service - for every service
provider, for every user, for all forms of information and for all
methods of information sharing.
Some examples of services:

• providing a welfare benefit (where the citizen is the ‘user’);

• collecting bulky household waste (where the citizen is the ‘user’);

• developing legislation (where the citizen is the ‘user’);

• granting a building permit (where a business is the ‘user’);

• arresting a suspect (where the Public Prosecution Service is the ‘user’).

• dealing with an appeal against arrest (where the suspect is the ‘user’);

• supplying personal data by electronic means (where the Benefits Intelligence



Agency is the ‘user’);

• verifying a person’s electronic identity online by means of DigiD (where the Tax Office


is the ‘user’). DigiD is the “Single Sign On” concept in the Dutch Public SectorICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   20
17-05-2010   16:26:10

## Page 21

Although the implications of a principle can have
consequences at all levels of the operation of an organisation,
its motivation will always be based on the ability to share
information with others, upholding the principle of subsidiarity
in the process.
The NORA principles are particularly important for inter-
organisational services, but even services that are only
required by internal users (such as HRM administration), are
advised to use these principles. They serve to strengthen
internal management and, as a consequence (albeit
indirectly), to improve service provision to third parties.

In the current situation, the carrier must await the arrival of the ship before he can
complete the paperwork. To do so, the carrier may need to send information to the
customs authorities Douane, the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority
Voedsel- en Warenautoriteit, the Plant Biological Service Plantenziektekundige
dienst, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs Ministerie van Economische Zaken, all
in different forms and via different systems. This is circuitous and takes a great deal
of time.
In the future, the carrier will be able to send information about the ship and its cargo
to the Portbase in advance of the ship’s arrival at the port. The Portbase system will
then send a single message containing all necessary information to all the agencies
and departments concerned. As a consequence, the carrier will only need to deal
with a single government agency. Cargo handling will be streamlined while all the
agencies and departments concerned will receive the information they need. This
does mean, however, that all those agencies and departments need to be linked up
with the international customs data model.

CONFORMITY TO NORA
NORA conformity indicates the degree to which a service
(including the underlying processes and systems) can be
seen to fulfil the NORA principles, either at present or, in the
case of a planned service, on implementation.
NORA conformity also applies to organisations, departments,
chains, etc., and in such cases the concept covers all the
services that fall within the scope of such bodies. Tests
have been developed to verify conformity to NORA. The aim
of a NORA test is the timely detection of any bottlenecks
with regard to interoperability that might arise in a particular
context.
ARCHITECTURE
In the public and private sector a common definition of
Architecture is: An architecture is a formal description of a
complex whole, and of the principles that are applicable to
the development of that whole and all its components.
22
NORA test
A NORA test comprises the following elements:

• description of the tested service (or process, system, organisation, chain, etc.);

• description of the context of the test;

• description of the way in which the test was carried out;

• selection of the principles that are applicable to and relevant for the context;

• for each selected principle: have the criteria of the principle been fulfilled?


Where possible, ensure that this appraisal is objectively verifiable. In some


cases, principles allow scope for interpretation, making a subjective appraisal


inescapable;

• if the criteria of the selected principle have not, or not fully, been fulfilled: on


what grounds does the service provider deem this acceptable? Considerations


could, for example, relate to legislative, technical or financial constraints;

• summary of the actual and potential bottlenecks that came to light in the


course of the test.

## Page 23

23
This definition includes both the principles that are applicable
to the design and the final design as such. In this chapter the
word architecture is consistently used as the combination of
principles used and the final design.
NORA covers common principles and the final design from an
interoperability point-of-view.
The complex whole has substantially more point-of-views
than interoperability alone.
The ‘whole’ as such can be an organisation or a chain, or
equally a single information system or a network, etc.  An
architecture is used as an instrument through which to steer a
project when steering the individual components alone would
not lead to the desired result.
When the whole is even more complex (such as ‘the public
sector’), a single architecture will not be sufficient; it will be
necessary to create a set of coherent architectures, each at a
different organisational level (municipal, government services,
etc.).
NORA usually cannot be used directly to develop a service in
a specific context, for example within a municipal authority.
Domain architectures are used to describe the architecture
used in specific parts of the public sector. Examples of
such domains are sectors (such as work & income, criminal
justice and juvenile care) and administrative layers (such as
the municipalities and the provinces). Domain architectures
pad out the NORA principles without actually forming part of
them.
It is also customary for larger scale projects to have an
architecture that describes the intended project result.
What is known as a ‘project start architecture’ is drawn up
in the early stages of the project 9. This is a translation of
the architecture at the next highest level to project-specific
parameters.

GEMMA
GEMMA stands for Municipal Model Architecture (taken from the Dutch name:
GEMeentelijk Model Architectuur). GEMMA is the common reference architecture for
municipal authorities and consists of architecture models, principles and a cohesive
set of solutions, knowledge documents and standards. With these, GEMMA assists
municipal authorities, at both the conceptual and hands-on stage, with the design
of processes, information delivery and data exchange. The authorities and their
suppliers need these standards to harmonize the processes and data used in the
chain of collaboration and in service provision 10.
MARIJ
MARIJ stands for Model Architecture for Government Services (taken from the Dutch
name: Model Architectuur RIJksdienst). MARIJ is a set of agreements concerning the
design of government services, designed to ensure a solid and cohesive basis for
such services. The architecture sets standards and defines specifications, setting out
the direction in which products and services, processes, organisations, information
flows and ICT will be developed 11.

4.	 Basic principles
NORA’s ten basic principles describe the most important
desired characteristics of public services, as seen from the
perspective of the user (the ‘what’). The principles make
no statement about the way in which these characteristics
should be realised or achieved (the ‘how’).
The basic principles are taken from a number of important
existing sources, including: the vision memo ‘Better Public
Sector Services’ Visie Betere Dienstverlening Overheid12,
the National Services and e-Government Implementation
Programme Nationaal Uitvoeringsprogramma Dienstverlening
en e-overheid4, the ICT Agenda 2008-2011 13,
the Netherlands Open Contact Action Plan actieplan
Nederland Open in Verbinding6, the e-Citizen Charter
BurgerServiceCode14, the European Interoperability
Framework 15, decisions taken by the Standardization
Council 16, the government’s own plans to modernise its
working methods Actieprogramma Andere Overheid17and to improve the efficiency and accessibility of its data
Informatie op Orde18.
The ten basic principles are primarily intended to provide a
roadmap and leave scope for interpretation. Specialist NORA
documents will be used to translate these basic principles
into guidelines and best practices.
PROACTIVE
Users will be provided with the service they need.
The service provider will take the initiative to notify the user
whenever other information is available that could be of
importance to the user. Services will be brought to the attention
of the user at the moment the user might need them. Any
changes in the progress of processes and registered information
will be reported. Services will be provided automatically
wherever possible, but the user will always stay in control.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   25
17-05-2010   16:26:10

## Page 26

26
Motivation
A service will be more useful to the user if he does not himself
need to keep track of when a next step needs to be taken.
Moreover, this will prevent the occurrence of undesirable
situations that ensue because the user has not responded in
time.
Rationale
Providing services to citizens on a demand-driven and
proactive basis is an important governmental spearhead (as
evidenced by the Electronic Government Action Programme
actieprogramma Elektronische Overheidand the cabinet’s
response to the recommendations made by the Committee
on ICT and the Public Sector) 19. The ICT Agenda 2008-
2011 also designates the user as the central factor in the
digital service society 13. The subtitle chosen for the NUP
4, ‘Citizens and businesses first’ Burger en bedrijf centraal,
underlines this principle, as do articles 4 and 5 of the Dutch
e-Citizen Charter 14 (‘Personalised Information’ and
‘Convenient Services’).
Implications
An important precondition is that service providers ‘know’
their users and integrate information from other organisations
into that knowledge. Proactivity demands that service
provision processes be redesigned from the perspective of
the user. It is by no means a given that services are always
initiated by a request from a user. A public sector organisation
can also take the initiative.
If no input is required from the user, the process can even be
completed unilaterally.

17-05-2010   16:26:10

## Page 27

27
FINDABILITY
Users can easily find a required service.
If users are looking for particular services, they will be able to
find them in the places where they expect to find them. For
this purpose, relevant information will be registered at search
locations with which the user is familiar. If the user happens
to select the ‘wrong’ service provider, he will still be assisted
(under the ‘no wrong door’ principle). If necessary, the service
provider will refer him to one or more other service providers.

Motivation
Many users do not know where or how they can obtain a
service. Quite often, they are not even aware that such a
service exists. This inability to find an appropriate service is
inconvenient for users. Services that cannot be found are
simply not used. That is the reason why service providers
must help users find the required service.
Examples
Many municipal authorities notify local citizens when a driver’s licence or passport is
about to expire.
Families with a minimum income are entitled to council tax relief. The municipal
authority can waive council tax on the basis of financial data from one or more
sources, such as the Tax Office’s Key Register of Income.
In two month’s time, your child will turn fourteen. The municipal authority sends
you a letter about the duty of all citizens of fourteen and older to be able to identify
themselves, explaining that a first ID card will be issued free of charge. Currently
this message would still be sent by post, but with the introduction of the ‘message
box’ principle, it would be sent via the channel of your own choice. The message
would include details of the town hall’s opening hours. For authentication purposes,
the child must visit the town hall twice in person: first with the application form and
passport photo and then a week later to collect and sign for the ID document.

## Page 28

28
Rationale
The Government Information (Public Access) Act Wet
openbaarheid van bestuur20imposes the obligation on
administrative bodies to provide information about policies,
including their preparation and implementation, at their own
initiative. This aim to improve findability has been set out
in various policy documents, including the memo ‘Towards
accessible government information’ Naar toegankelijkheid
van overheidsinformatie21and the memo on the efficiency
and accessibility of its data Informatie op Orde18. The
e-Citizen Charter 14also subscribes to this principle, as
shown in article 2 under the heading Transparent Public
Sector.
Implications
Public sector organisations need to know what information
users normally look for and where they look. Such information
can then be registered at the search locations with which
the user is familiar (search engines, portals, catalogues,
registers, etc.). The service itself will also be equipped with
the necessary search facilities. If it is necessary to refer the
user elsewhere, the service provider must also be aware of
the other locations where the service(s) can be found.
ACCESSIBILITY
Users have easy access to the service.
Service providers attune their accessibility to the methods
preferred by the users. This concerns the selection of
communication channels, the times at which contact
is possible, and the user-friendliness of the methods of
communication.
Example
The Products & Services Catalogue provides an overview of public services; it is acces-
sible via all channels. In addition, Overheid.nl contains an overview of all legislation and
regulations, official publications and announcements. Users can, of course, also make
use of a search engine.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   28
17-05-2010   16:26:10

## Page 29

29
Internet is the preferred channel for communications,
because it makes it possible for both individuals (via
websites, e-mail, etc.) and for systems (via electronic
messages) to make contact at any time of the day or night.
Nonetheless, there will always be users who cannot or do
not wish to make use of internet, perhaps because of some
disability, or lack of skills, or because they do not have an
internet connection. A service must also be available for them
as well.
Motivation
An accessible service will be better used and will not exclude
any group of users.
Rationale
The Online Administrative Business Act Wet elektronisch
bestuurlijk verkeer22states that conventional, paper-
based communications may not be supplanted by electronic
communications. One of the principles upheld by the Act is
that the citizen may decide in which form communications
will be effected, and that it is not permitted to deal with
certain matters solely by electronic means unless all parties
concerned have given their consent. In line with that principle,
the vision memo ‘Better Public Sector Services’ Visie Betere
Dienstverlening Overheid12establishes that all channels
should be open and available. Citizens, businesses and
organisations decide for themselves which communication
channel they wish to use to contact public sector or
government bodies. Article 1 of the e-Citizen Charter
14 (Choice of Channel) points out the importance of the
demand-driven use of communication channels.
Implications
Research still needs to be done to establish the target
group’s demography, and how the various groups of users
actually use some particular service (user research). On the
basis of the findings, decisions can be made as to which
communication channels will be used and in which way.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   29
17-05-2010   16:26:10

## Page 30

30
This could mean that multiple communication channels need
to be used (internet and telephone, for example), possibly via
multiple portals (using different websites for different target
groups, for example). In such cases, it will not be possible to
serve all users according to their wishes. The preferences of
users will have to be weighed against the costs and benefits
of he various channels and portals, always respecting the
condition that no user may be excluded.
If multiple channels and portals are offered, there must be
a guarantee that the results of the service provision will be
independent of the chosen channel and the chosen portal,
even if these are intermixed. Regardless of whether a
question is received by post, e-mail or telephone, the answer
should be the same.
UNIFORMITY
Users experience uniformity in service provision through
the use of standard solutions.
Using generic solutions, which are widely applied within
the public sector, certain elements of one service can be
harmonised with corresponding elements in other services.
This can be achieved, for example, by using shared
processes and systems (shared services) or by applying open
standards to provider-specific processes and systems; both
will have the same standardising effect.
Motivation
Standardization and the ensuing uniformity will mean that
users become familiar with a uniform way of working. As a
result, the service will become easier for them to use (and
therefore cheaper). Moreover, the re-use of standard solutions
often has benefits in terms of costs for the service provider.
Rationale
It is mandatory for public sector organisations to use open
standards 6. The open standards designated by the
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   30
17-05-2010   16:26:10

## Page 31

31
Standardization Council are subject to a ‘comply or explain’
regime 23. In the National Services and e-Government
Implementation Programme 4, the various management
layers have agreed about the use of the basic infrastructure.
The Personal Public Service Number (General Provisions)
Act Wet algemene bepalingen burgerservicenummer24arranges the use of the citizen service number
burgerservicenummeras a standard identification number.
The Online Administrative Business Act 22determines that
an administrative body can impose further demands on the
use of electronic communications.
Implications
Public sector organisations do not develop their own processes,
systems and technologies when these are already available.
They must keep abreast of standard solutions, both currently
available and planned, so they can take these solutions into
account when drawing up their own plans. The chapter entitled
‘Building blocks’ contains an overview of the most important
standard solutions that service providers may use.
Next, the usable elements will have to be integrated into
the provider’s own organisation. Standard solutions are
not always a perfect fit, of course. Willingness to accept
compromises is, therefore, a necessity. If a standard solution
is not yet available, organisations can make sure their own
solutions are suitable for use by others. They can do this, for
example, by collaborating on development and by making
their solutions available either as open source or as open
standards. This is the way new standard solutions will be
delivered.
Examples
Individual citizens can use a DigiD to log in to the websites of various public sector
organisations using a unique user name and password.
Use of the citizen service number contributes to the efficient and reliable exchange of
personal data.
For the purposes of electronic messaging, public sector organisations internally use the
standards defined in the Dutch government’s service bus protocol.

PACKAGES
Users are offered related services as a package.
When services, or their component parts, are closely related
as seen from the user’s perspective - they are offered to users
as a package. The user gets the impression that they are just
one single service. For this purpose, service providers must
make agreements with each other, which may mean that
background processes - or some parts of them - are also
integrated, although this will not always be the case.
Motivation
It saves the user a great deal of time if the services that he
expects as a service package, are in fact found together in
one place and as a combination.
Rationale
The National Services and e-Government Implementation
Programme 4and the e-Citizen Charter 14both support
this principle, the latter in article 4 entitled Personalised
Information.
Implications
First and foremost it is important to know how users make
use of the service and how they associate the service with
other services.
On the basis of those findings, services providers can
start collaborating. They will need to determine how they
will package their services. In the case of the issue of
combined licences or permits, for example, matters such
as documentation and enforcement must be arranged.
Will the issuing body carry out these tasks alone, or will
the collaborating organisations each carry them out in a
decentralised fashion? Whichever solution is chosen, there
will be a need for intensive collaboration and harmonisation
between the organisations involved.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   32
17-05-2010   16:26:10

## Page 33

33
Packages can be created in several different ways. For
example, by the design of portals (web page, call centre,
desk, etc. with a referral function) around important events
(so-called ‘life events’ such as moving, renovating a house,
a birth, etc.), themes (such as the status of all current
processes together), target groups (students, OAPs, etc.) or
individuals (personal web page).
Each of these portals still refers users to individual services
but that could be avoided by fully or partially integrating the
services. In this further reaching form of packaging, websites
and forms or even entire procedures could be combined.
Example
Anyone who wants to build a house can be confronted with a multitude of permits and
regulations. There are different regulations for residential property, for space and for the
environment, each with their own municipal officers, criteria, procedures, time scales,
fees and supervisory bodies. The licences are often issued by quite separate public
sector organisations. This is inconvenient, time-consuming and expensive. Moreover,
it can lead to contradictory decisions. The Environmental Permits (General Provisions)
Act brings an improvement to this situation by clustering all the various components
into a single environmental permit. The contact point for applicants is the local authority.
Behind the scenes, the various public sector organisations consider the application from
their own perspective (Can those trees be cut down? Does it fit in with the zoning plan?
Is that driveway in the correct place?), but they coordinate their activities in order to
provide the applicant with a single decision.

17-05-2010   16:26:10

## Page 34

34
TRANSPARENT
Users have access to information relevant to them.
Before, during and after the service is provided, the service
provider gives the user information about the result, the
process and the information used. This information includes
general information about the actual service and specific
data about the user himself. It is particularly important to
provide information about the significance (semantics) of the
information used, about the status of the service process
and also about the information on the user that is being
registered.
Motivation
Users want to know where they stand. It is therefore
essential for them to have insight into the service process.
Transparency also makes it easier to do business with public
sector organisations and to harmonise services between
public sector organisations.
Rationale
The Online Administrative Business Act 22determines
that the administrative body should make it known if
electronic communication channels are available for use.
The Government Information (Public Access) Act makes
provisions for the perusal of certain government documents
20. The Personal Public Service Number (General
Provisions) Act 24provides that an overview must be
available showing how the citizen service number is used
and giving insight into the various users and into the personal
data that can be registered and shared with other users.
The National Services and e-Government Implementation
Programme 4advocates a reduction of the administrative
burden; one way to do this is to make it easy to track and
trace the course of transactions. Transparency of ways
of working is also one of the quality requirements of the
e-Citizen Charter 14.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   34
17-05-2010   16:26:10

## Page 35

35
Implications
It must first be decided what information is relevant to users.
To this end, reliable and durable information will be made
available to anyone who wishes to make use of it. Such
information might be:
• a description of the service;
• conditions of supply or delivery;
• what information is being used;
• the significance of the information used;
• what the way of working is;
• how the process of service provision is progressing;
• how results (particularly decisions) come about.
REDUNDANCY
Users are not confronted with redundant questions.
The service provider uses information that is already known,
to the service provider or to other service providers, and
makes information available to other service providers.
Procedures and regulations are simple, so that users need
only provide a minimum of new information.
Example
After they receive a property tax assessment, owners of premises can visit the property
tax desk at the town hall and ask to see the valuation report. They will then have access
to Land Registry data, zoning maps and photos and can point out any errors in such
information, so that immediate steps can be taken. The result of this transparency is that
fewer objections are received, with more adequate argumentations.
A private home-owner wants to create a driveway giving access from his premises to the
public road. At the town hall, he receives information about the licences and permits he
needs a quotation for the alterations to that part of the public road and a summary of the
procedures, timescale and costs involved. After he submits his application, the home-
owner is kept informed about the acceptance of his request, the further procedures, the
planning schedule and how he can keep abreast of progress.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   35
17-05-2010   16:26:11

## Page 36

36
Motivation
Limiting the demand for information reduces the administrative
burden. For the user, unnecessary requests for information are a
waste of time and only cause irritation; moreover they increase
the risk of errors in the information ultimately provided.
Rationale
The principle of ‘collect once, use many times’ is an
important spearhead of policy for the Dutch government
12. The creation of a series of key registers has been an
important consequence of this policy 25. In the declaration
of intent entitled ‘e-Government means better services, less
administration’ 26, municipal and provincial authorities,
water boards and the national government have committed
to improving services for citizens and businesses, and
to achieving the planned reduction of the administrative
burden through the use of ICT-based solutions. The ‘Single
Request for Data on Work & Income Act’ Wet eenmalige
gegevensuitvraag werk en inkomen27states that each
piece of information that the partners in the work and income
chain need to carry out their work may only be collected from
the individual concerned once. The principle of once-only
collection of data is also embedded in the Environmental
Permits (General Provisions) Act Wet algemene bepalingen
omgevingsrecht28.
Implications
Prevention is better than cure. Firstly, public sector
organisations need to simplify their rules, procedures,
forms, etc. as much as possible so that the need to ask for
information can be reduced.
Secondly, they need to know which elements of the
necessary information are already available to other
such organisations, and under whose responsibility such
information falls. Subsequently, the information managers can
draw up agreements about the sharing of information and
decide which technical facilities need to be arranged so as to
make sharing possible. Finally, forms can be adapted so that
information that is already known can readily be filled in.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   36
17-05-2010   16:26:11

## Page 37

37
Conversely, the service provider will need to share his
information with any other service provider that wishes to
make use of it (insofar as this is permissible). Procedures
and documentation must be developed, and technical and
other facilities put in place, for this purpose. As others are
also dependent on this information, the highest standards of
quality, management and durability need to be met.
CONFIDENTIALITY
Users can rely on the information not being misused.
The service provider guarantees that information is available
to authorised persons only and will be solely used for the
purpose for which it was collected.
This principle applies not only to information about private
individuals, but also to information about businesses and
the government itself. Such information may be misused as
company data that might serve as the basis for investment
decisions could be of interest to competitors, and information
about government premises could be of interest to terrorists.
Motivation
Confidentiality is an essential characteristic of the relationship
between a user and a service provider. It is only when users
feel secure, that they will be willing to use a service and
provide the required - possibly confidential - information.
Example
After Mr R died, his widow continued to receive letters from the municipal authority in
his name in spite of the fact that his death had been recorded in the municipal personal
records database. The reason for this was that various systems are used by the munici-
pal authority. As these are not all linked to the personal records database, this can lead
to distressing situations like this one. Were all systems linked to the personal records
database, death notices would only need to be processed once to be available in all
circumstances.
Such details as are already known are pre-printed on income tax return forms issued by
the Tax Office. Users do not need to provide these details again.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   37
17-05-2010   16:26:11

## Page 38

38
Rationale
The General Administrative Law Act Algemene wet
bestuursrecht29obliges public sector organisations to
maintain the confidentiality of data. The Personal Data
Protection Act Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens30obliges public sector organisations to use personal data only
for well-defined, clearly demarcated and justified purposes,
and sets a number of due care criteria (e.g. personal data
must be processed in accordance with the law and in a
proper and careful manner). The Government Information
(Public Access) Act 20also provides that a request for
information can be rejected on grounds such as respect
for privacy or to avoid the possibility of disproportionate
preference or prejudice.
Implications
Measures are to be taken to ensure that no unauthorised use
is made of information. Premises and systems must be made
secure against unauthorised access and malafide software.
Measures must also be taken to ensure that employees do
not have access to information that is not intended for them.
Transaction logging makes it possible to check whether there
has been any breach of confidentiality.
RELIABILITY
Users can rely on the service provider adhering to the
arrangements.
Both the availability and the quality of services conform to
predetermined standards. For example, any information
provided must be correct, authentic, up-to-date and complete.
Processes are designed in such a way as to guarantee this
conformity, and the quality level is actively monitored.
Example
The government has taken measures to prevent a doctor accessing information about
his patient in an electronic patient record without the consent of the patient.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   38
17-05-2010   16:26:11

## Page 39

39
Motivation
If services are to be convenient to the user, they must be
reliable. Links in any chain of services need to be able to
rely on that fact, because the quality of their own services
often depends on such reliability to a certain degree. If there
are recurrent failures to meet standards, users will become
irritated, start to complain and ultimately abandon the service.
Rationale
The quality aspects that apply to information can be found
in the legislation regulating the key registers and in the
Online Administrative Business Act 22. This principle is also
embedded in the e-Citizen Charter’s article on Accountability
and Benchmarking 14.
Implications
Public sector organisations investigate what level of quality
is deemed adequate by the users. This level of quality is then
designated as a standard and made known to all concerned.
Processes are subsequently designed that will uphold this
standard and the results actually achieved are reported.
Where quality can be variable, an indication will be given -
along with the information - of the current quality level (for
example, when the information was last verified).
Example
In the case of building permits, there is a six or twelve-week period in which a decision
must be taken; the time scale depends on the nature of the permit in question. As long
as certain requirements have been met, the permit will be granted after that time by

OPEN TO FEEDBACK
Users can provide input about the service.
Users can submit corrections, complaints, etc. to the service
provider, either on request or on their own initiative. The
service provider can use this input to improve the quality
of the service. In this way, users have the opportunity to
constructively promote their own interests.
Motivation
Users expect that their government listens to them, is open to
criticism and that it is seen to be acting on that basis as well.
Being open to feedback and input is an essential precondition
for boosting mutual confidence. It also encourages
participation and self-reliance.
Rationale
The General Administrative Law Act 29sets the minimum
requirements that an administrative body’s internal
complaints procedure must fulfil. The e-Citizen Charter 14states (in the article entitled ‘Considerate administration’), that
the government and public sector organisations use feedback
information to improve their products and procedures. In the
vision memo ‘Better Public Sector Services’ Visie Betere
Dienstverlening Overheid, the cabinet has indicated that
it will measure public appreciation of the government’s
services on a regular basis 26. This will bring bottlenecks
and problems to light and allow improvements to be carried
through.
Implications
Input from users will be collected and analysed
systematically. Effective indicators are user complaints,
requests for the correction of data, and suggestions for
improvements to services. The service provider can also take
the initiative to ascertain how users experience the services
provided. System-generated messages and user statistics
can also be used as a form of direct or indirect input.
Procedures must be set up to provide users who submit
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   40
17-05-2010   16:26:11

## Page 41

41
input or feedback with a timely and appropriate response.
Management processes must be designed so that planning
and control strategies can make allowance for the input of
users.
Example
The Customer Contact Centre of UWV, the Dutch employee insurance agency, has
approx. 1.3 million ‘customers’ and receives over 25,000 phone calls a day. The CCC is
able to provide the caller with an answer to his query during the first phone call in over
90 percent of cases. Nearly 75 percent of the users say that they are satisfied or well
satisfied about the way in which they were helped. This result is possible thanks to an
international management model especially designed for CCCs, known as the Customer
Operations Performance Center (COPC). The COPC measures the quality and the
performance of the CCC. One of the preconditions for certification, for example, is that
the CCC analyses incoming phone calls and, on the basis of the findings, is able to make
an inventory of the aspects that are the most frequent causes of customer complaints,
and then seeks a structural solution for the underlying problems.

5.	Building Blocks
NORA assumes that service providers design their services in
a modular way. This chapter describes a number of important
building blocks that have a positive effect on interoperability.
Rationale
The following sources have been used to create the summary
below:
• Legislation. Compulsory; this is especially relevant and

applicable to the key registers 31.
• Open standards. The Standardization Council’s list 23of

‘comply or explain’ standards, drawn up at the request of

the government.
• The basic e-Government infrastructure. Drawn up by the

national government, provincial and municipal authorities

and the water boards and presented in the National

Services and e-Government Implementation Programme

(NUP) 4.
• Building blocks managed by the Dutch digital government

service Logius 32. Further information (also in English)

can be found on www.logius.nl/producten.
This document sets out to provide a brief explanation and
description of the building blocks. Further details of the
building blocks and the way in which they are being applied
can be found in specialised NORA documents.

Basic architecture for public sector
organisations
NORA assumes that the work processes within any public
sector organisation will approximate the overview given in
Figure 1 below.
Figure 1: Basic architecture for public sector organisations
Users of services contact a public sector organisation by
means of one or more contact functions (shown in blue). To
facilitate the exchange of information (shown in yellow), the
contact function is linked to the operational processes (shown
in orange) and to the processing and the management of
information (shown in grey). The symbols used here are those
commonly used in diagrams of NORA and other government
architectures.

Overview of standard building blocks
Figure 2 illustrates the building blocks of the basic
architecture for individual public sector organisations. These
are the links that ensure that the work processes of different
organisations are interconnected. The various links will be
described briefly below, but further information can be found
in the e-Government Routeplanner 33. The Routeplanner
also includes other instruments that can play a signification
role in achieving and maintaining interoperability. The various
NORA supplements look at the use of the building blocks in
more detail.

Contact functions
The building blocks that public sector organisations use to
support or facilitate their contact with citizens, businesses or
other public sector organisations.
Web guidelines
Information on websites which meet the web guidelines 34is accessible to everyone, irrespective of the software or
hardware used. For building websites, there are internationally
recognized agreements in the form of web standards. The
Dutch government has combined these standards in the web
guidelines quality model. This model comprises 125 quality
criteria required to improve government websites which are
accessible to all users.
Cooperating catalogues
This NUP building block 35ensures that users can find
information, even when searching on the website of another
government level not involved in the subject they are looking
for. Users no longer face a ‘closed door’ but will be forwarded
to the relevant services desk. This means that citizens
and businesses can quickly and easily access information
about products and services they need on the websites of
participating governments.
Answer for Businesses
This portal is available to all businesses looking for up-to-
date and relevant government information, e.g. about laws
and regulations, permits and government grants. The object
of Answer for businesses 36is to improve online provision
of services by the government to businesses and reduce the
administrative burden through request-based presentation of
information and services.
MyGovernment
This facility is a personal and secure web environment
in which citizens can handle their affairs and exchange
information with all levels of government, wherever
and whenever they wish to do so, and as quickly and
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   45
17-05-2010   16:26:12

## Page 46

46
economically as possible. This concerns e.g. filing a tax
return, applying for a social security benefit, or a building/
tree-felling permit. Connection to the MyGovernment 37website implies for government authorities that their services
can be easily located and that it will become easier for
them to send messages to specific groups of citizens, e.g.
residents of a particular neighbourhood.
Answer
Several government authorities are working together to set
up a service provision concept 38, a multichannel desk that
citizens and businesses can contact for answers to almost
all questions they may have; a client contact centre (KCC).
In the NUP it has been agreed that all municipalities with a
population of 100,000 or over will set up a KCC connected to
the 14+ dialling code. It has also been agreed that information
on products of provinces and water boards will be made
available to the municipal client contact centres.
Identity management
Identity management concerns all facilities used in
the administration of users and - on the basis of that
administration - in regulating their access to electronic and
other services.
DigiD
DigiD 39is the digital authentication system for the
government and public service providers. DigiD ensures
that you can conduct reliable business with citizens through
your website. If someone logs on to your website using his
DigiD, DigiD will feed the Citizens Service Number back to
you. Using this number, you are able to find out from your
own administration or in the Local Council Personal Records
Database who you are dealing with and which information
you already have about a particular person.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   46
17-05-2010   16:26:12

## Page 47

47
DigiD Authorize
DigiD Authorize 40gives citizens the opportunity to
designate an individual to look after their interests online.
Individual citizens sometimes want another person or a
business relation to act on their behalf as their representative.
Citizens can apply for an authorization code for a specific
online service. They give this code to their representative.
After activating the authorization the representative can
access the specific service on behalf of the citizen with his
own DigiD (digital identity).
Citizen Service Number
The citizen service number (BSN) 41is a citizen’s personal
number for contacts with the authorities. This unique number
helps, for example, to avoid cases of mistaken identity.
Everyone registering with a municipality for the first time
is assigned a BSN. Newly-born children are also assigned
a BSN on the registration of their birth. The BSN offers
citizens and the authorities benefits: it simplifies contacts
with the municipality and other government agencies and
organisations
PKIoverheid
An electronic certificate from PKIoverheid 42guarantees
the reliability of the exchange of information by e-mail and
the Internet, and identifies whether that information comes
from the government, citizens or businesses. Thanks to the
certificate, the recipient knows for certain from whom the
information has originated. Additionally, with a certificate from
PKIoverheid, a legally valid electronic signature can be placed
and confidential information can be encoded.

Key registers
To do its work properly, the government needs access to data
that is stored in over 30,000 different systems. Key registers
43ensure that this information is available in a simpler and
less fragmented form. The essence of the key registers is to
have one location in which to store all the information that
belongs together. Ultimately these individual key registers will
function as a single, cohesive whole: the key register system.
This system will ensure that all relevant data and information
from all relevant registers is directly available to help answer
any question or resolve any problem. The principle of using
key registers has been embedded in legislation, and their use
is compulsory for public sector organisations.
The Municipal Personal Records Database
Everyone must notify the municipality of a birth, change of
address or death. The authorities need correct information
about the country’s citizens, for example when issuing a
passport, identity card or driving licence, determining who
may vote in an election, paying social benefits and collecting
municipal taxes. However, the records are also used by
others: organisations such as the Netherlands Tax and
Custom Administration, benefits agencies and pension funds
also use your personal details to tailor their decisions closely
to your situation. The Municipal Personal Records Database
44has been in existence since 1 October 1994.
Register of non-residents
The register of non-residents 45records some basic data on
non-residents in a single register. Together with the municipal
personal records database, the register of non-residents
will form the Key Register of Natural Persons. More then 2
million people have a relationship with the Dutch government
but do not actually reside in the Netherlands, at least not
permanently. Just think of a German tourist who owns a
house in Friesland, or a Dutchman who is enjoying retirement
in a house on the Spanish coast. These people have
relationships with various Dutch public sector organisations,
and each of these organisations has its own register of non-
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   48
17-05-2010   16:26:12

## Page 49

49
residents, but for different purposes. The register of non-
residents collates all this information.
Key Register New Trade Register
The Key Trade Register 46includes data on enterprises
and legal entities, i.e. sole proprietorships, partnerships,
companies and branches, foundations, associations and
public/government organisations. The New Trade Register will
facilitate better services to businesses. They will only need to
provide their information once to the Chamber of Commerce,
which maintains the New Trade Register. Public sector
organisations can consult the trade register and do not need
to repeatedly ask businesses for information that has already
been provided.
Key Registers of Addresses and Buildings
The Key Register of Addresses lists all towns, street names
and house numbers. The Key Register of Buildings contains
data on buildings, premises (semi) permanent locations and
moorings. These are municipal registers, jointly known as Key
Registers of Addresses and Buildings (BAG) 47. All data is
made available centrally trough a national system managed
by the Dutch Land Registry Office.
Key Registers Cadastre and Topography
The Key Register Cadastre 48consists of the cadastral
registration -the official registration of all property-related
information- and the cadastral maps. The Key Register
Topography consists of digital topographic maps at various
scales, its core being TOP10NL, a digital topographic map file
of the Netherlands.
Large Scale Topographic Base Map of the Netherlands
The large scale standard map of the Netherlands 49is a
digital topographical map with minimal standardised content
and standardised precision, showing the principal topography
of the terrain (buildings, roads, waterways). The scale used
varies from approx. 1:500 to 1:5,000. The map is suitable for
a variety of uses, and users can overlay their own information
if they wish.

Key Register of Vehicles
The Key Register of Vehicles 50includes data on all Dutch
registered vehicles and their owners. RDW, the Centre for
Vehicle Technology and Information, provides information to
citizens and businesses on the basis of the recorded data.
The register has national coverage, and is accessible for
public sector organisations such as the police and the Tax
Office.
Key Register Income
The Key Register of Income 51contains accurate income
data on approx. thirteen million Dutch citizens. This is the
aggregate taxable income received. If the aggregate income
is not calculated, the taxable wage income earned during the
last calendar year is used.
Key Register of Real Estate Value
The Key Register of Real Estate Value 52includes details
of the assessed value of all real property. To make these
values practically useful, supplementary information such as
the valuation date, the designation of the real estate and the
name of the person who received the valuation assessment is
also recorded.
Key Register for the Subsurface
The Key Register for the Subsurface 53contains data from
geological, geophysical and soil scientific surveys, soil maps,
geological maps and models, as well as information regarding
subsurface infrastructure and licences for natural resources.
The aim is to make all public data regarding the subsurface
easily accessible. Archaeological information and data about
the environmental quality of the subsurface may be added to
the register at a later date.

Electronic information exchange
The reliable and efficient exchange of information between
public sector organisations is one of the most important
cornerstones of interoperability. A number of generic
solutions are used to support this exchange.
Digikoppeling
Digikoppeling 54is the government’s “internal postman”.
Digikoppeling comprises a set of standards for electronic
messaging between government organizations. If you
implement these standards in your own software, you can
easily exchange digital messages with fellow government
organizations. This is done through the connectivity of
Diginetwerk, the Internet or a different type of connection.
Digikoppeling is an NUP (National Implementation
Programme for Service Provision and e-Government) building
block.
Digimelding
Data contained in basic registries has to be as reliable as
possible. If an official suspects that specific data contained
within a basic registry is incorrect, he has to be able to
register that suspicion. That can be done using Digimelding
55. Digimelding is a central point for registering potential
inaccuracies in basic registries. By using Digimelding, the
registered incident will arrive at the correct government body
or bodies. The official will then receive a message about the
outcome of his registered incident. Digimelding is an NUP
building block.
The System Catalogue
Users of basic registries - such as authorities - have to know
precisely which data they are dealing with. The System
Catalogue 56is an online catalogue that describes the
structure of the basic registries system and the definitions of
types of objects, data and messages. With that information,
users are able to easily take data from the basic registry or
registries and apply this to their own work processes.
ICT 4452NORA maart 2010-ENG.indd   51
17-05-2010   16:26:13

## Page 52

52
The definitions in the System Catalogue have been taken
from the various basic registries. The System Catalogue is a
basic NUP tool.
Government Transaction Portal
The government transaction portal 57is a communication
channel with the government and public sector that can be
used by businesses. Each business or organisation that is
connected to the portal can exchange digital information with
the government. This may be useful for businesses that have
to provide information to government bodies or departments
on a regular basis. The government transaction portal ensures
that the information is directed to the correct recipient and
that the information sent by a public sector organisation will
be delivered to the correct business.
Public Sector Interconnectivity
The public sector interconnectivity 58protocol creates
links between the individual networks of public sector
organisations so as to create a single virtual network for the
entire government domain. In many situations this renders it
unnecessary to install separate network facilities for individual
applications. A virtual network of this kind also facilitates the
secure and effective exchange of information between the
public sector organisations.
