Extended description

Signalen is an open source process and task system for governments, which automatically categorizes and routes reports about public space for processing by the appropriate handler. The City of Amsterdam receives about 300000 reports about public space every year. From furniture in the garbage to abandoned boats in the canals. More than 1400 civil servants work 24/7 to handle reports in Signalen. Since the introduction of Signalen, customer satisfaction with the handling of reports in Amsterdam has increased by more than 30 percent. Signalen software is open source and can be used freely by other governments and municipalities.
